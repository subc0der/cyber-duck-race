### How It Works

1. **Each participant gets a duck** - Different colors help you track them
2. **The race is 15 seconds long** - Enough time for drama and excitement
3. **Ducks race from left to right** - Their names appear next to them
4. **Truly random outcomes** - Every race is different, every participant has an equal chance

### Race Mechanics

The race uses a sophisticated physics engine to ensure fairness:

- **Each duck has unique characteristics** - Random speed, acceleration, and stamina
- **Speed changes constantly** - Every 1-3 seconds, creating dramatic racing
- **Final sprint surge** - One lucky duck gets a boost near the finish for excitement

### What You'll See

- **Race Progress** - Info box in the top-right shows time remaining and progress
- **Duck Names** - Displayed to the right of each duck
