### 1. Project Structure
- Created complete folder structure for React + Vite project
- All directories in place: src/, public/, docs/, .github/workflows/, .vscode/

### 2. Configuration Files
- ✅ package.json (React 18.3, Vite 5.3, ESLint, Prettier)
- ✅ vite.config.js (with aliases and port 3000)
- ✅ .eslintrc.json (React-specific rules)
- ✅ .prettierrc (code formatting)
- ✅ .gitignore
- ✅ index.html (entry point)

### 3. React Components (Created but need styling)

- ✅ ControlPanel.jsx - Race controls with countdown
- ✅ BettingPanel.jsx - Betting interface
- ✅ Leaderboard.jsx - Winner tracking
- ✅ WinnerModal.jsx - Victory display

## What Still Needs to Be Done ❌

### 1. Core Systems (CRITICAL)

- ❌ src/utils/racePhysics.js - Not created (CRITICAL for race functionality)

### 2. Styling (0% Complete)

- ❌ .vscode/extensions.json

### 5. Dependencies & Testing
- ❌ npm install not run yet
- ❌ App not tested/verified

## Known Issues ⚠️

1. **constants.js was interrupted** - File creation was stopped by user
2. **No physics engine** - racePhysics.js is referenced but doesn't exist
3. **No styles** - Components reference CSS files that don't exist
4. **Not runnable** - npm install hasn't been executed

## Next Immediate Steps (Recommended Order)

1. **Complete constants.js** - Critical for app functionality
2. **Create racePhysics.js** - Core game logic
3. **Add minimal CSS** - At least index.css and App.css to make it viewable
4. **Run npm install** - Install dependencies
5. **Test basic functionality** - Ensure app starts

## Technical Decisions Made

- **React 18.3** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite** for build tooling (faster than CRA)
- **Canvas API** for race animation (60fps target)
- **CSS Modules** approach (individual CSS per component)
- **Context API** for state management (no Redux needed)
- **Crypto API** for secure random winner selection

## File Counts
- **Created**: 13 files
- **Remaining**: ~17 files
- **Total Planned**: 30 files

## How to Continue

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd cyber-duck-race
npm install

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/complete-core-systems

# 3. Complete the missing critical files in this order:
# - utils/constants.js
# - utils/racePhysics.js
# - styles/index.css (minimal to start)

# 4. Test the app
npm run dev

# 5. Once working, create PR for review
```
